    - move (used to move to different locations)
    - launch (launches various phases of the mission (liftoff, burn for the moon))

## minigame instructions (spoilers!!!!!!!!)

- to use joystick controls simply type left, right, up, down, or wait depending on which direction you want to go. wait will pass the time before landing without changing your position. you may want to be careful here, as mistyping may cause the joystick to move wildly, along with your capsule.
